## **Chapter 1: Formatting the Old PC**

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the kickoff of my home server project! Imagine this: this forgotten PC, originally my dad's ex-workstation, is sitting idle. Armed with an Intel i3 8th gen processor, no flashy GPU, and a humble 8 gigs of RAM, I saw potential in turning it into a nifty home server.

**The Appeal of Repurposing**

Repurposing would let me use the home server to back up files, stream movies and media, deploy my projects, and learn some other cool stuff

### **Backing Up Data**

**Importance of Data Backup**

There were not a lot of files to be backed up. So I used Google Drive to back a few of them up. The rest would get purged.

## **Chapter 2: Clean Slate**

**The Decision to Start Fresh**

The chapter culminates in the decision to wipe the slate clean by formatting the existing Windows 10 installation. Reasons behind this choice include eliminating unnecessary clutter, ensuring a fresh start, and optimizing the system for its new role as a home server.

As there was a single SSD, with multiple partitions, I combined them into one and went ahead with the Linux Installation.

With no Ethernet cable in sight, the spotlight turned to USB tethering. This technology, often underutilized, allows a seamless connection between a computer and a mobile device, effectively transforming the mobile phone into a gateway to the digital realm.

### **Setting Up IP and Gateway via USB Tethering**

**The Failed Attempt with Manual Net Tools Installation**

Initially, I attempted a manual installation of net tools from the official Ubuntu website. The process involved mounting the tools on a USB drive, but alas, it proved to be a cumbersome task and didn't yield the desired results. It was time to pivot.

**Embracing USB Tethering**

Enter USB tethering - a more straightforward and reliable solution. Connecting the mobile phone to the PC via USB cable initiated the tethering process. A quick check using `ip link` revealed the available network interfaces, among which the USB-tethered interface took center stage.

**Configuring IP and Gateway Settings**

The next step involved setting up the IP address and gateway for the USB-tethered interface. A judicious choice of values ensured a stable internet connection

Let's go through the steps:

1. Check available network interfaces
    
    ```bash
    ip link
    ```
    
2. Recognize the USB interface and assign an IP address manually. Assuming IP as `192.168.42.10/24` and interface as `enp0s20u1`
    
    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.42.10/24 dev enp0s20u1
    sudo ip link set enp0s20u1 up
    ```
    
3. Set the default gateway using the following command
    
    ```bash
    sudo ip route add default via 192.168.42.1 dev enp0s20u1
    ```
    
4. Reboot
    
    ```bash
    reboot
    ```
    
5. Try to ping an external IP to confirm if the connection works.
    
    ```bash
    ping 8.8.8.8
    ```
    

*In case of errors, check for Firewall rules*

### **Achieving Internet Access**

With the USB tethering setup, the old PC was now online. Internet access meant that the installation process could proceed without any hiccups.

**Updating Linux and Adding Net Tools**

The newfound internet connection was immediately put to use. The system underwent a thorough update, ensuring that the latest Linux packages were on board. Additionally, the previously elusive net tools were seamlessly added to the arsenal, simplifying future networking tasks.
